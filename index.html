        <p>Trevor Noah grew up in the apartheid era in South Africa and yet to that, was in addition, the trauma of his relationship with his stepfather, Abel. This alternate title engulfs the double-edged burden of systematic racism and domestic abuse in Trevor's life growing up. It reflects both the political and personal cages he had to break free from.</p>

        <p>The quote "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife... but never fell in love with subservient women... 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage .'" deeply reflects the contradictions in some men's expectations of women, both in Trevor Noah's story and in today's society.</p>
        <p>Many men claim to be attracted to independent women, but once in a relationship, they feel threatened by that independence. The desire to "put her in a cage" shows a need for control and not love. Abel loved Patricia's strength, but instead of celebrating it, he tried to break it.</p>
        <p>This pattern still exists today. For instance, successful women often face partners who are uncomfortable with their careers or confidence. A working mother might be expected to manage both a full-time job and all household duties- because “traditional” roles are still deeply established. Social media is full of stories where women are criticized for being "too ambitious" or "too outspoken" in relationships.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The quote also touches on a broader issue: control disguised as care. Many relationships fail because one partner seeks power rather than partnership and this is not right because,</p> <p id="conclusion">True Love Allows Freedom.   </p>
