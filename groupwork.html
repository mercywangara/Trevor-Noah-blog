                    The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in
                    a scary future where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom,
                    and Offred is a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife,
                    Serena Joy. She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her
                    husband and daughter, who were taken away.

                    Patriarchy is a social system built upon unequal power relations that men maintain over
                    women.<br> In “The Handmaid’s Tale”, patriarchy is a theme that illustrates Gilead’s social
                    structure,
                    the <br>oppressive control men exert over women, and how it devalues women of their reproductive
                    roles,<br> individuality, and basic rights. Men held all political, social, and economic power,
                    while
                    women were<br> categorized by their roles, eg, wives, marthas, and handmaids, each with a specific
                    role.
                    The handmaids,<br> for instance, were reduced to their ability to bear children and were seen as
                    instruments of procreation,<br> while the wives were valued for their obedience to their husbands
                    and the ability to run their households.<br> The novel also highlights religious patriarchy in the
                    sense that roles for men and women were shaped <br>around biblical ideas of gender. For instance, in
                    the bible where a slave or servant would perform the role<br> of a concubine, with the resulting
                    children being considered as part of another woman. In Gilead, women <br>are stripped of their
                    economic, political, and reproductive rights which aligns to the situations in our society<br>
                    where women face discrimination in employment, limited access to education and restrictions in
                    their bodily<br> rights for example, child marriages, forced marriages and lack of access to
                    abortion
                    services are real life<br> manifestations of control over women’s lives.

                    In the Handmaid's Tale, power is the main issue. Gilead’s leaders control everyone,<br>
                    especially women. The government, run mostly by men, takes away people's freedom<br> to keep
                    itself in charge. Women like Offred, a Handmaid, are treated like objects, given<br> names like
                    “Of Fred” to show they belong to their commanders. They can’t make their <br>own choices, and
                    harsh punishments, like public hangings, scare them into obeying. <br>Gilead also uses spies,
                    called the Eyes, who watch everyone’s every move, making<br> people afraid to speak out or act
                    against the rules. But not everyone gives in. Off

                    In the book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, the concept of fear is exposed in many occasions amongst
                    the young<br> women, who were only for the role of surrogacy, within the oppressive society of
                    Gilead. Today, even in the<br> contrast of societal settings between Gilead and current society, the
                    concept of fear is still portrayed in many<br> aspects. The Gilead setting was that, in any case of
                    deviation from expected moral conduct, such as trying to<br> escape from designated bounds and
                    committing adultery, heavy punishments, which are: breaking of legs and<br> being hung publicly
                    respectively for the above cases, were executed on the victims, not only to stop them from<br>
                    messing up again but also to send out a warning to the rest, who seemed to be lucky not to be
                    in that situation<br> for the moment. Current society reveals fear in almost similar circumstances
                    of unfair treatment yet choosing <br>to move on in silence. For example the fear to lose one’s job
                    because of complaints to unfair work conditions,<br> the fear of imprisonment because of criticism
                    to prevailing authorities and this can even include death cases <br>and cases of abduction, fear of
                    religious leaders who tend to threaten their audiences with disastrous <br>experiences for violation
                    of any instructions, among other fears.
